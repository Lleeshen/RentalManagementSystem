# RentalManagementSystem
By Lyman Shen and Felicia Kuan. 

This is a web application we collaborated on to complete for our Database Systems (COEN 178) final project. 

The objective was to both design and implement a web application called "Happy Renter's Rental Management INC" that manages rental properties on behalf of the clients. It is a DBMS meant to assist a rental manager in keeping track of rental properties and lease agreements. The assignment was assigned by Professor Rani Mikkileni of Santa Clara University. 

Basic properties: each rental property managed by Happy Renter's is managed by one supervisor, and the database keeps track of the original property owner, current renter, supervisor, address of the rental property, number of rooms, monthly rent, and status that can be "available" or "leased." Basic information on the property owner is also stored in the database, as well as the rental property's start date of availability. 

Basic features and capabilities of the application: Given the user criteria, a list of available rental properties fulfilling those criteria is generated, along with (????) an image of the property. Users can also search for renters who rented more than one rental property and the average rent for properties in the town, with the town entered as input. Additionally, users are able to search for properties that will expire in the next two months and create a lease agreement using a GUI (????). 

We used php to create the web page.
