    Manager(empid, branchid


      Foreign key (empid) references Employee(empid),
      
      
      Foreign key (branchid) references Branch(branchid));
		
    
    Supervisor(empid,


      Foreign key (empid) references Employee(empid));

Rental_Property (rental_num, status, address, num_of_rooms, month_rent, date_of_availability, 


      phone, empid,


Foreign key (phone) references Property_Owner (phone));


Lease Agreement (rental_num, start_lease_date, renter_name, home_phone, work_phone, 


      deposit_amt, rent_amt, supervisor_name, 


      Foreign Key (rental_num) references Rental_Property (rental_num));


Relationship definitions:
	
  
Branch and Manager have a one to one relationship


Supervisor and Rental_Property have a one to many relationship


So, primary key of Supervisor(empid) is attribute in Rental_Property


Rental_Property and Property_Owner have a many to one relationship


So, primary key of Property_owner (phone) is an attribute in Rental_Property


Lease_Agreement is a weak entity dependent on Rental_Property
